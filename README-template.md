## My process
- My first time doing this (Sunday) I did not know what to do. I tried to use div to fit everything inside, used all kinds of display, the qr code picture would overflow, it was a mess. On the following day (Monday) I paired up my education with freeCodeCamp by learning beginning HTML and CSS and watched a few more videos and I attempted the QR code replica again. This time, I successfully made the QR code. 

I used div as the main body of the QR code container and only used <p> so that I can fully customize it on CSS. My problem before was using <h1> and <h2> and had a tough time customizing it on CSS. Next, the CSS was the challenge. I always find CSS to be difficult at the moment, but I pushed through. I used everything I learned to recreate the replica and I successfully made a duplicate. Only problem is that the whole div is not in the center of the screen. I am not sure how to fix this, but I am still proud of my creation. This represents the beginning of my programming journey!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Text-align
- Box-model

### What I learned

Imposter syndrome is strong. Being confused is discouraging. The first day of attempting this first (EASY) project, I struggled and had no hope for improvement. But I pushed anyways because I have an ambition, a drive, a vision to create awesome web programs. By learning how to program, I can fully express my creativity and have fun with it! This mindset has brought me to learn and deal with the struggle. Particularly with the code, here are some snippets I am proud of:

CSS:
img{
    max-width: 250px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
div{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    width: 250px;
    padding: 13px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: auto;
}

I am proud of this because this shows how I was able to successfully align everything within the div perfectly. 

### Continued development

I will continue to work on CSS. I feel that I have a strong understanding of HTML. CSS is my weak spot, specifically I want to improve on the layout to make an eye-appealing website. I believe all I need to know to fully grasp CSS are the box-model, layouts, and general concepts in aesthetics.
